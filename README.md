## Utilize a noSQL data base to harness The UK Food Standards Agency's evaluation of various establishment's hygiene. 

### Begin by Setting a Database. 

Using pymongo, a noSQL database package, connect to the UK Food Standard Agency's database to learn more about various resturnats' hygiene. Due to local reports from Dover township authorities, we were permitted to delete all rows containing data about all establishments in Dover, as they were automatically not of interest. Finally some columns data types had to be transoformed for analysis. 

### Analysis of Establishments. 

This code searches for establsihments with a certain hygiene score, and provide you with pertiment information.
